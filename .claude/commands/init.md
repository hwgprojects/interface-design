description: Smart dispatcher - detects mode and builds UI with craft, memory, and enforcement. For interface design (dashboards, apps, tools) — not marketing sites.

Use the design-engineer skill to establish or apply a design system.

**Scope:** Interface design only — dashboards, apps, tools, admin panels. Not for landing pages or marketing sites.

Start by checking if `.design-engineer/system.md` exists in the current project:

- **If it exists** → You're in APPLY MODE. Read the system and use its established direction and patterns.
- **If it doesn't exist** → You're in ESTABLISH MODE. Help the user establish a design direction, then offer to save it.

The skill will guide you through:
1. Assessing context to form a design direction hypothesis
2. Getting user confirmation with ONE question
3. Building with quality standards
4. Offering to save the system for future sessions

Consult the skill's reference files as needed:
- `references/directions.md` for the 6 design personalities
- `references/principles.md` for craft quality standards
- `references/validation.md` for pre-delivery checks
