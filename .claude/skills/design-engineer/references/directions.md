# Design Directions

This skill is for **interface design** — dashboards, admin panels, apps, tools. Not for marketing sites or landing pages.

Before writing any code, commit to a design direction. Don't default. Think about what this specific product needs to feel like.

## Think About Context

- **What does this product do?** A finance tool needs different energy than a creative tool.
- **Who uses it?** Power users want density. Occasional users want guidance.
- **What's the emotional job?** Trust? Efficiency? Delight? Focus?
- **What would make this memorable?** Every product has a chance to feel distinctive.

## The 6 Personalities

**Precision & Density** — Tight spacing, monochrome, information-forward. For power users who live in the tool. Think Linear, Raycast, terminal aesthetics.

**Warmth & Approachability** — Generous spacing, soft shadows, friendly colors. For products that want to feel human. Think Notion, Coda, collaborative tools.

**Sophistication & Trust** — Cool tones, layered depth, financial gravitas. For products handling money or sensitive data. Think Stripe, Mercury, enterprise B2B.

**Boldness & Clarity** — High contrast, dramatic negative space, confident typography. For products that want to feel modern and decisive. Think minimal dashboards, data-forward apps.

**Utility & Function** — Muted palette, functional density, clear hierarchy. For products where the work matters more than the chrome. Think GitHub, developer tools.

**Data & Analysis** — Chart-optimized, technical but accessible, numbers as first-class citizens. For analytics, metrics, business intelligence.

Pick one. Or blend two. But commit to a direction that fits the product.

## Product Type → Direction Mapping

| Product Type | Suggested Direction |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Dashboard / Admin | Precision & Density |
| Settings / Config | Utility & Function |
| Documentation | Utility & Function |
| Collaborative Tool | Warmth & Approachability |
| Finance / Sensitive Data | Sophistication & Trust |
| Analytics / BI | Data & Analysis |

## Color Foundation

Don't default to warm neutrals. Consider the product:

- **Warm foundations** (creams, warm grays) — approachable, comfortable, human
- **Cool foundations** (slate, blue-gray) — professional, trustworthy, serious
- **Pure neutrals** (true grays, black/white) — minimal, bold, technical
- **Tinted foundations** (slight color cast) — distinctive, memorable, branded

**Light or dark?** Dark modes aren't just light modes inverted. Dark feels technical, focused, premium. Light feels open, approachable, clean. Choose based on context.

**Accent color** — Pick ONE that means something. Blue for trust. Green for growth. Orange for energy. Violet for creativity. Don't just reach for the same accent every time.

## Layout Approach

The content should drive the layout:

- **Dense grids** for information-heavy interfaces where users scan and compare
- **Generous spacing** for focused tasks where users need to concentrate
- **Sidebar navigation** for multi-section apps with many destinations
- **Top navigation** for simpler tools with fewer sections
- **Split panels** for list-detail patterns where context matters

## Typography

Typography sets tone. Don't always default:

- **System fonts** — fast, native, invisible (good for utility-focused products)
- **Geometric sans** (Geist, Inter) — modern, clean, technical
- **Humanist sans** (SF Pro, Satoshi) — warmer, more approachable
- **Monospace influence** — technical, developer-focused, data-heavy
